# Vectorization and parallelize
## Vectorization
### SIMD(Single Instruction Multiple Data)
- process vector with a single operation
- provide data level parallelism (DLP)
- products as extention (AVX(Advanced Vector Extensions) serial)
- Intel(R)'s product: SSE(streaming SIMD Extentions)
- SSE Packed instructions needs to be used to do vector calulations
